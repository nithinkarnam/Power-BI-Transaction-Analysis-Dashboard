Power BI Transaction Analysis Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into transaction amounts and remaining balances across various cities, currencies, and banks. The dashboard enables users to filter transactions based on multiple parameters such as bank names, cities, device types, genders, payment methods, transaction types, and purposes.

Key visualizations include:

Column charts for transaction trends over time.

Tables with conditional formatting for a structured view of spending and balances.

Interactive slicers for filtering specific data points.

Bookmarks for customized views.

This project provides detailed financial insights by making transaction data interactive, insightful, and well-visualized.

ðŸš€ Steps Followed in Development

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing

Imported transaction dataset into Power BI.

Cleaned and transformed data:

Changed data types for accurate processing.

Created a derived column for Age Groups.

Filtered null or irrelevant data entries.

Enhanced dataset with calculated fields:

Calculated remaining balance dynamically.

Aggregated total spending per month.
